## Assignment: Pac-Man Game

### Description:

This enhanced version of the console-based Pac-Man game introduces additional features such as ghosts, score tracking, and power-ups. The game is still text-based but offers a more dynamic and challenging experience.

### Features:

1.	Pac-Man (P): The player controls Pac-Man using 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right) to navigate through the maze.
2.	Ghosts (G): Ghosts move randomly around the maze, and if Pac-Man encounters a ghost, it's game over.
3.	Dots (.): Represented by dots on the board, Pac-Man can eat these for points.
4.	Power-ups (*): Special power-ups that Pac-Man can consume to gain temporary invincibility and the ability to eat ghosts.
5.	Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of dots eaten.

### Instructions:

1.	Pac-Man (P) starts in the middle of the maze.
2.	Move Pac-Man using 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.
3.	Eat dots (.) to score points.
4.	Avoid ghosts (G), touching a ghost results in game over.
5.	Consume power-ups (*) to gain invincibility and eat ghosts.
6.	The game ends when Pac-Man is caught by a ghost.
7.	Try to achieve the highest score by eating as many dots as possible.
